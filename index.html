        		<h1>KAG Official Server Rules</h1>
				<h2> Last updated 15/04/2019</h2>
			<p>	By playing on King Arthur’s Gold official servers, you agree to obey the rules listed below and incur any penalties given by server admins if your behaviour goes against them in any way. Official Server Admins should refer to this document to ensure they are providing fair, informed outcomes to situations. It is the player’s responsibility to keep up to date with these rules as they may be modified without notice.

If you see a player breaking any of these rules, you can report them in-game using !r (KAG username) or tagging an admin using ‘@Ingame Server Admin’ in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/kag">Official KAG Discord</a>.

If you believe you have been wrongly punished, you may appeal the ban by posting in the appropriate forum thread:
Banned from an official server: https://forum.thd.vg/threads/21688/
Banned globally from all servers: https://forum.thd.vg/threads/1713/

Penalties given can be classified into three categories:
Minor: Minor penalties are typically the result of first offences. These include any warnings, mutes, hiding nicknames, kicks or short-term bans (typically a few hours).
Moderate: Moderate penalties result from an escalation of minor level penalties, warnings or the nature of the offence (for example griefing.)  They typically include longer mutes/bans.
Severe: Severe penalties involve longer bans, typically without prior warning of said ban. A severe penalty may also result from prior offences or simply the nature of the offence (for example hacking). A severe penalty also includes any global or permanent bans.

Reports are dealt with at the admin’s discretion. Repeat rule-breakers may incur harsher penalties than those listed under each rule.



Chat-Related Rules

Spam: Defined as any irrelevant or unsolicited message that attempts to flood the in-game chat box. Spamming includes any repetitive phrases, words or sentences, whether by a single person or a group of people with no intent to contribute to current conversations.
Spamming is classified as a minor penalty.

Purposeful avoidance of chat filters: Using the addition of symbols such as *, white spaces or the intentional misspelling of words with the intent to bypass the in-game chat filter.
Similar to spam, continuous avoidance of the chat filter is classified under minor penalties.

Racism/Discrimination: Content that is abusive or discriminatory is not permitted on official servers under any circumstances. This includes material that is racist, derogatory, vulgar, overtly sexual or any material that promotes hatred, discrimination or prejudice against a religion, ethnic group, race, gender, sexual orientation or age.
Anything deemed this will be dealt with accordingly, typically with moderate or severe penalties.

Controversial subjects: Anything controversial or offensive will be dealt with accordingly. This may include religion, politics, sexual activity or historically offensive events. Controversial subjects range between minor and moderate penalties.

Flaming/Harassment: Any messages with the intent to discriminate, degrade or bully a player will be acted upon accordingly. The implications of this depend on the context of the situation as deemed by the player(s) involved or an admin. Flaming or harassment will incur minor to moderate penalties. It is advised that players ignore, using the in-game function, anyone that is harassing them and contact an admin to deal with the situation.

Impersonation: Impersonation of a player, admin, or member of THD for any reason will be dealt with accordingly, either by minor or moderate penalties.



Gameplay-Related Rules

Griefing: Actions with the intent to hinder your team, such as destroying own-team structures, blocking doors, or spamming shops are not tolerated.
The severity of the penalty depends on the extent of the grief, though typically these will incur moderate to severe penalties.

Trolling: Much like griefing, any actions with the deliberate intent to hinder your team, such as mass building shops, buying excessive boulders et cetera, may incur minor or moderate penalties.

Teamkilling: Intentionally killing your teammates may result in minor or moderate penalties depending on the situation. The intent of the teamkill is at the discretion of the admin.

Hacking: Any manipulation of the KAG application while playing online by any program to alter the game’s behaviour, including modifying working memory, is not tolerated and will be severely punished. With evidence, the player will incur severe penalties.

Exploitation of glitches: The exploitation of bugs, flaws, limitations or weaknesses within the KAG game that are judged to be game breaking, or exploited with the intent of benefiting from these is not tolerated.
You will be given minor ranging to severe penalties depending on the severity/frequency of the exploitation.
If you do find a glitch, report it on <a href=" https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-base/issues">Github</a> and do not continue to abuse it in game.

Attempting to crash servers: Actions with the intent of crashing or slowing down an official server are strictly prohibited. If caught attempting this, you will incur moderate to severe penalties depending on the extent of harm (or potential harm).



Miscellaneous Rules

Clan tags: Similar to “Impersonation,” if the clan tag you wear is used by an established clan of which you are not a member and you are asked to remove it by a clan owner, an admin may ask you to remove the tag.
If the clan tag falls under “Racism, Harassment or Discrimination,” you will be asked to remove it. Failure to do so will result in a minor to moderate penalty.

Nicknames: See “Racism/Discrimination”
Any nickname judged to be racist or discriminatory may result in you being asked to change the nickname. Failure to do so will result in a minor or moderate penalty.
You can change your in-game nickname either by changing your steam nickname or using the console (opened with the HOME button) and using the “/cl_name (name)” command.

False vote-kicking: Starting a false vote-kick is prohibited. The vote-kick will be cancelled and you may incur a minor penalty.
If you have been falsely kicked, contact an admin on the discord server using ‘@Ingame Server Admin’ to be unbanned.

False reporting: False reporting a player using the in-game !r (name) command or on the Discord may incur a minor penalty. Excessively false reporting may lead to a minor or moderate penalty.

Symbolism: Symbolism which falls under “Racism/Discrimination” is prohibited. This includes the building of Swastikas or vulgar imagery. Doing so will incur a minor or moderate penalty. Symbolism may also include the creation of offensive language using blocks, which may result in a minor penalty.

Intentional AFK or non-participation: Intentionally AFKing in-game, especially in a full server, either in a team or in spectator may lead to a kick via anti-AFK timeout or by an admin to free up server slots.
Non-participation such as building art or not contributing to your team’s efforts (for example ‘roleplay’ building in a competitive game mode) may lead to a vote-kick or a warning. Failure to comply may lead to a kick in order to open server slots.
