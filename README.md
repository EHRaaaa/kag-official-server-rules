```
TODO:

- consider reworking the page into markdown for easier editing
- agree on whether this, or the google doc used for drafting is the canonical source of rules
- add linkable #ids to each rule and use that for back-linking when rules refer to each other
- clean up ambiguosity of "may lead to" vs "will lead to"
- link in-game

```
